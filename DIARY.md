**Mood:** 😊
**What I did:** Implemented the Calendar widget for the dashboard project. Added the widget to index.html with month navigation buttons, created CSS styling for the calendar grid, and wrote JavaScript functions to render the calendar days with proper month handling and today highlighting.
**Learned:** How to calculate calendar days using JavaScript Date objects - getting the first day of month, days in month, and handling edge cases for previous/next month day display.
**Challenges:** Making sure the calendar grid always has exactly 42 cells (6 weeks) for consistent layout, and correctly identifying the current day to highlight it.
